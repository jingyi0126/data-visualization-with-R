# üìä R Data Analysis & Visualization Project

## üîç Project Overview  
This repository contains a structured series of R Markdown (`.Rmd`) files that walk through the essential steps of data analysis and visualization using R. The project covers topics ranging from basic data manipulation to statistical testing and predictive modeling. A strong emphasis is placed on **data visualization**, using powerful R packages like `ggplot2`, `patchwork`, and `plotly` to create informative and aesthetically pleasing graphics.

Whether you're exploring tidy data principles or evaluating regression models, this project showcases how **clear and effective data visualization** can support understanding and communication of statistical findings.
